    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>New York Style Pizza is defined by its crust. Unlike Neapolitan crust, it is thin, crisp, and less bubbly. The crust at the end should be a bit thicker, but the middle should be thin and soft enough to fold. The dough is topped with just a thin layer of sauce, and dry, shredded mozzarella is used instead of fresh, which gives you a more even melt and those lovely browned spots of cheese. 

Some people say that the water in New York is what makes NY-style pizza so delicious—some restaurants even have New York water sent to them across the country for that “authentic” taste because of the water’s pH balance. Some even call the area’s water the “champagne” of water! Chefs outside of New York don’t subscribe to that thinking, and neither do I because this crust is just like a slice from NYC!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread flour</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
        <li>Instant yeast</li>
        <li>Lukewarm water</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>5 minute pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>The day before:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl of an electric mixer add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast.</li>
        <li>In a separate jug add the warm water and oil.</li>
        <li>Turn the machine on to medium speed and add the wet ingredients into the dry. Just add enough liquid for the dough to form a ball. (The dough can be made by hand if you knead it for roughly 8-10 minutes on your work surface).</li>
        <li>When the dough is ready (see above video), divide the dough into three (xx) balls and place each in a container with a sealable lid. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least one day, and up to 4 days. The dough can also be frozen at this stage.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The next day:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>At least two hours before baking, remove dough from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature to take the chill off it.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F (250°C) and place in a pizza stone or tray if using. Turn a dough ball out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently stretch the dough by draping over your knuckles into a 12-14 inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Slide the pizza base onto a flat baking tray lined with parchment (see video above).</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the surface of the crust, almost to the edge. Sprinkle cheese over sauce followed by any of your favorite pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake for roughly 12 - 15 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown. Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
